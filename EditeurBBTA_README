To create a map for "Bang Bang Total Annihilation" start XNATileMapEditor.exe
Choose the size of the map that you want to create, a size of 20 x 50 is considered small.
Click on "Nouvelle carte"  (New Map) to set the grid.

Give a name to your map, the minimum number of players for the map, and the maximum number of players
for the map.

Each tile contain a number, the number indicate the tile type in BBTA.

Currently supported types are:

0   empty
1   dirt
-1  spawn point

Be sure to verify that the number of spawn points match your recommended maximum number of players.

Left click on a tile to increment the ID of the tile, right click on it to decrement the ID.

When you are happy, set an output name for your map (Nom de sortie) and click "Sauvegarde" (Save).

Be sure to include the .xml extension to the output name.

Ie:  "Monster.xml" will create a xml file with the name "Monster".
If you forget to add the extension you can manually add it, but the game will only load compatible *.xml files.


The tile editor will create your file in the same folder that the program is located.

Move your map to the "Carte Jeu" folder of BBTA.
